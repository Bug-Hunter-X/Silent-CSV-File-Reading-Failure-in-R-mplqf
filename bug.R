```R
# This code attempts to read a CSV file, but it fails silently if the file doesn't exist.
file_path <- "my_file.csv"
data <- tryCatch({
  read.csv(file_path)
}, error = function(e) {
  # This error handling is insufficient. It doesn't provide informative feedback.
  message("Error reading file.")
  return(NULL) 
})

if(is.null(data)){
  # This condition only checks if the file reading process failed.
  # It doesn't handle scenarios where the file exists but contains errors.
  print("File reading failed.")
}
